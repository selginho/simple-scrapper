# Simple Web Scrapper

## The Challenge

The challenge consists in finding "the answer" using a web crawler.

"The answer" is behind a click of a button here http://applicant-test.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

You should create a crawler that emits requests and read the answers in low level (without any browser emulators like puppeteer, selenium, phantomjs, jsdom, etc). This crawler should be capable of read "the answer" produced and write that on the screen.
